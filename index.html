        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to this comprehensive exploration of software development skills and subjects, housed within this website. Here, I aim to not only showcase my completed projects but also illuminate the essential skills required for success at Templemore College of Further Education, culminating in a QQI Level 5 qualification. The deliberate choice of a blue background with white font serves a dual purpose: it enhances readability and professionalism while evoking trustworthiness, positivity, and ensuring universal accessibility for all users. </p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Creating this website primarily involved the utilization of HTML and CSS, the foundational languages of web development. However, the journey of crafting a functional and visually appealing website extends beyond more code. It's crucial to possess a wide array of skills encompassing design principles, user experience considerations, and problem solving abilities. Dedication of significant time and effort to mastering these skills is paramount, as each course module presents an opportunity for growth and learning.
            Self-directed learning emerges as a cornerstone of success in software development education. While classroom instruction provides a solid foundation, the pursuit of knowledge outside the confines of formal education is equally important. This self-directed exploration complements class education, allowing for a deeper understanding of concepts and practical applications. Search engines like Google serve as invaluable tools in this pursuit, offering a treasure trove of resources, tutorials, and community forums where aspiring developers can seek guidance, share insights, and discover new ideas. 
            In the realm of software development, staying in trends is essential for staying competitive. Self directed learning empowers individuals to explore areas of interest, experiment with new tools and frameworks, and continuously refine their skills. It fosters a culture of lifelong learning, where every challenge becomes an opportunity for growth and every setback a chance to  improve. 
            Ultimately, the combination of formal education and self directed learning equips aspiring developers with the knowledge, skills, and resilience needed to thrive in the ever evolving field of software development. By embracing a mindset of curiosity, adaptability, and continuous improvement, developers can navigate the complexities of modern technology and make meaningful contributions to the digital world. </p>
        <h3>Subjects</h3>
        <p>The modules completed for this webpage project have key subjects to the course, including Mobile Technologies, Software Architecture, and Work Experience. Additional features on the Tools page, such as the BMI calculator and Histories section, enhance the project's depth. In Mobile Technologies, I developed a prototype app for BMI calculation, an Android Native Application for health tracking, and conducted mobile network configuration tasks. Software Architecture covered Agile methodology, User manual creation, Java fundamentals, and detailed discussions on methodologies like the Waterfall approach. Work Experience is documented through a comprehensive diary reflecting on practical experiences gained with Fit. </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Embarking on the Software Development course at Templemore College has been an immensely rewarding decision, enabling me to pursue a passion that I've long contemplated. The college's principal ensures a supportive environment for all students, helping whenever needed, and the commitment to health and safety is evident in its well-maintained facilities, fostering an ideal environment for both study and personal growth. As the curtains draw on this narrative, I find myself at the precipice of reflection, poised to gaze upon the journey undertaken in pursuit of software development excellence. It's been a journey marked by moments of triumph and tribulation, where each obstacle served as a steppingstone toward personal and professional growth. With a heart brimming with gratitude, I know that the lessons learned, and bonds forged shall forever illuminate the path ahead. </p>

        <h2>What is pair-programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programing is a software development technique where to people work together. One person writes the
            code, while the other checks each line of the code while its being written. They switch the roles frequently
            to maintain a high level of collaboration and work quality. This method uses excellent communication,
            teamwork and sharing knowledge. It achieves better work and problem solving faster.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Advantages of pair programming and where it is best suited for use?</h3>
        <p>Advantages: <br>
            Improves the quality of the code as less mistakes would be made because the other person who reviews the
            code they would be able to notice them when its being written. As the person who writes the code might not
            notice it himself. Problem solving with two people more eficient rather than one. Knowledge sharing between
            two people creates bigger and better ideas. Sharing the task between each other and keep swapping places
            maked the work more productive.
            Best suited for use: <br>
            Where the risk of errors are high, to avoid the errors. If menoting new reqruit would be ideal as the new
            reqruit would get to watch what he is showing and at the same time when swapping places he gets to do the
            same thing as mentor was showing him.
        </p>

        <h2>What do you think are typical pairing of people in pair-programing></h2>
        <p>Typical pairing based on level of skill sets, experience level, project requirements. A good example would be
            mentor and a new reqruit as the reqruit would get so much needed, useful information to become great in his
            position line of work and the mentor would learn better communication for instance as this is very
            important. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What disadvantages does pair-programming have?</h2>
        <p>Disadvantages: <br>
            Increase of a cost as two emploers would be working on a same task instead of one. Effectiveness as the two
            paired people might not get along because of the level skill sets they would have maybe different levels.
            There is no independance as you are working in a team of two and this can effect persons creativity.
        </p>

        <h2>How would pair-programming work in an Agile work environment?</h2>
        <p>Pair programing is great for Agile work environment as work is divided into short cycles. Each pair can work
            on different combinations of work and get the work done faster. This method makes sure of high level of
            customer service satisfactory.</p>

        <h2>Is pair-programing compatible with Agile manifesto?</h2>
        <p>Yes it is very compatible with Agile manifesto as its very efficient in software development process and
            flexible.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>How does this method benefit a pair programming, when one programmer is far less experienced than the other?
        </h2>
        <p>Asking and answering questions stimulates critical thinking and ideas in pair programming. By asking
            questions the more experienced developer encourages the less experienced developer to think more about the
            task rather than only receiving instructions. They both gain better problem solving skills.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Why is the pure driver/navigator scenario unhelpful for an inexperienced programmer?</h2>
        <p>When inexperienced prgrammer only observes instead of coding, he misses out on understanding the conceps of
            the code. Where if he was explained on what he has to code and he codes it it would be much better
            situation.</p>

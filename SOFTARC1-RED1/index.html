        <p>Agile is an approach to project management and software development that gives flexibility, collaboration and
            continuous improvement. Instead of following a plan such as waterfall methodology from start to finish,
            Agile teams work in short iterations called sprints to deliver small parts of a product.</p>

        <p><b>More control: </b>Work can be broken down into parts and conducted in rapid, iterative cycles. The regular
            meetings that are part of agile allow project teams to share progress, discuss problems and work it out the
            solutions. It makes the entire process more transparent.</p>
        <p><b>Better productivity: </b>Projects are completed in shorter sprints, making them more manageable. It also
            allows products to be rolled out faster and changes to be easily made at any point during the process.</p>
        <p><b>Better quality: </b>ability to find problems and create solutions quickly and efficiently. Flexibility of
            the agile method allows project teams to respond to customer reaction and constantly to improve the product.
        </p>

            provides immediate feedback. Team is able to make tweaks for the customer to their expectations and desires

        <p>Any size or type of the organisations can use Agile, big or small. Organisation will decide on the amount of

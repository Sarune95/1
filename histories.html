        <h1>How Photographs Were Transmitted by Wire: Spot News (1937)</h1>
        <p>In this video we can see Motors Sales Corporation in a workplace responsible for pictures of a "spot news",
            it shows that they get all the information needed from other people simply by phone calls.
            It give us all the information needed on how pictures were made and send by then.
            Every available developer of science engineering has been rushed to get the storie to the reader in the
            shortest possible time. Sending pictures by wire, traveling almost as fast as the telephone stories as wire
            photos use to go across in the 1930s.
            Wire photo transmission was then simply a lamp light scaning the original picture which makes alot of
            current, lots of current makes lots of light on the receiving machine which then exposes the negative.
            The negative then goes throught the regular routine which is to develop and print.
            Which before it took days and weeks to deliver the photo.

        <h1>U.S. NAVY BASIC MECHANISMS OF FIRE CONTROL COMPUTERS MECHANICAL "COMPUTER" INSTRUCTIONAL FILM.</h1>
        <p>Fire control computers solve fire control problems. Their solutions depend on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Own ship course and speed.</li>
            <li>Targets range.</li>
            <li>Targets baring.</li>
            <li>Targets course and speed.</li>
            <li>Wind speed and direction.</li>
            <li>Initial radius velocity.</li>
        </ul>
        Many factors are constantly changing but the computer continuously and instantly solves the problem and send the
        answer to the guns as orders. Workers operate the director which sends the target range and baring to the
        computer.
        <ul>
            <li>Shafts are commonly used to carry values throught out the computer which have two rotations,
                in one dirrection is possitive, in other direction is negative.</li>
            <li>Cams were used as computing mechanism. All cams had a working surface and a follower.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>The Clock That Changed the World (BBC History of the World)</h1>
        <p>In this video we learn about accuracy of time keeping.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This clock that we see is made by Harison brothers John and James in 1727.</li>
            <li>Working piece is made mainly from wood.</li>
            <li>John wanted to keep time not on land but at sea for the sailers as navigation in the sea were very
                difficult a the time to know where are you or in wchih dirrection are you sailing to.</li>
            <li>John Harison tought he could do it with a clock.</li>
            <li>If the clock is set to english time and it says three clock in the after noon, then its understandable
                that you are three hours behind england.</li>
            <li>He build it to help to save lives at sea.</li>

        </ul>

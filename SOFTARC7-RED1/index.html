        <p>Waterfall method is an approach to a sequential project management where tasks are completed one after
            another. It follows the steps of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requirement gathering</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Implementation</li>
            <li>Testing/Deployment</li>
            <li>Maintenance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each stage is completed before moving to the next, making it hard to backtrack if changes needed later.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Requirement gathering</h3>
        <p>The requirement phase states what the system should do. At this stage you determine the projects scope from business obligation to user needs.</p>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Once all requirements are collected, the focus shifts to the design phase. At the design phase designers work on crafting solutions aligned with the gathering requirements.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>Once the design undergoes finalization and receives approval, the implementation phase commences. Design teams pass on their specifications to developers for execution. This stage also unveils any potential implementation challenges. If significant obstacles arise, reverting to the design phase for reassessment becomes necessary.</p>
        <h3>Testing/Deployment</h3>  
        <p>Once the developers finish writing the code based on the design, its time for quality assurance. This means checking everything to make sure the product works well for users.</p>
        <h3>Maintenance</h3>  
        <p>After the product is launched, developers might need to fix any bugs that appear. Customers report any problems they encounter to your support team. Then its the teams job to deal with those reports and release updated versions of the product. Each stage relies on the one before and thats why there is not much room for mistakes between or within these phases.</p>
        <p>Lets say if a stakeholder wants to add a new requirement during the verification phase, you will need to review the entire project again. This could lead to scrapping everything and starting from the scrach again.</p>    
        <hr>
        <h3>Requirement gathering</h3>
        <p>Resources required for the project.</p>
        <p>What each team member will work on and at what stage.</p>
        <p>A timeline for the entire project. outline how long each stage will take.</p>
        <p>Details on each stage of the process.</p>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Establish schedules and project milestones.</p>
        <p>Specify the precise deliverables.</p>
        <p>Develop designs or blueprints for the deliverables.</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>Formulate an implementation startegy.</p>
        <p>Gather requisite data or conduct necessary research for the build.</p>
        <p>Delegate specific tasks and distribute resources among team members.</p>
        <h3>Testing/Deployment</h3>  
        <p>Testers write down what they are going to test.</p>
        <p>They keep track of any problems they find in the product.</p>
        <p>Testers check one thing at the time.</p>
        <p>They decide what things to measure to see if the product is good enough.</p>
        <p>They try out different situations and places where people might use the product to make sure it works everywhere.</p>
        <h3>Maintenance</h3>  
        <p>Developers might need to fix any bugs that appear.</p>
        <p>Customers report any problems they encounter to your support team.</p> 
        <p>Then its the teams job to deal with those reports and release updated versions of the product.</p>

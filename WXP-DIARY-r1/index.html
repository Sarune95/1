        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <h3>22.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>On my first day, we all connected on the main group meeting video link to have an introduction. We were all
            explained what we are here to do. After the main group meeting, we all gathered into our own small groups
            that we were put into. In our separate group chat we met our tutor, decided on what each one of us wanted to
            do from the briefs by getting into small groups of two to cover each topic in the brief. By our mentor we
            were told to sign up to IBM Skills Build webpage.</p>

        <h3>23.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>On my second day at 10am I connected with my group through video chat. Through the whole day we did two main
            things as we concentrated on the logo making, deciding which one we like the most. After the decision making
            on logo, all of us went on doing our Project Management Fundamentals IBM Skill Build. I completed Project
            Management Fundamentals, but it was not easy as it took a lot of time to do it.</p>

        <h3>24.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>As we all gathered on the video chat, we started working on our webpage design and color scheme. The color
            scheme was difficult to decide on, but eventually we decided which colors we were going to put together.
            Later, we had a speaker talking to us.</p>

        <h3>25.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>Today we were deciding and getting all the information needed on what we are going to include on our website.
            Everyone was building our power point presentation on what they had chosen to do for the brief. The time
            went extremely fast as everyone was terribly busy.</p>

        <h3>26.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>First thing in the morning after joining video chat, we talked to our teacher. We went through our power
            point with him on what we have done so far. He was incredibly happy with the outcome. After we went back to
            concentrate on doing the webpage. </p>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <h3>29.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>As we all gathered on the video group chat. Our teacher sent us a message that we must start to do AI
            Microsoft online course today. We all stayed on the video chat while doing this course by ourselves for the
            entire day. During the course we received a message in the video chat that he will talk to us tomorrow to
            check in on how we are getting on and to go through everything. I completed the requested course. It was not
            easy as it took a long time to complete by watching videos of the course. </p>

        <h3>30.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>In the morning as we all got together, we went through our presentation with our teacher where everyone had
            to do their talking on their slides. He was happy about all the slideshows that we did. Everything was great
            and that made everyone happy. </p>

        <h3>31.01.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>Today we all practiced doing the presentation again by timing. Show our website to our teacher and talk about
            it. The teacher gave us all the information needed about how we are going to present our presentation
            tomorrow to three people listening to us and asking a few questions after the presentation. I encountered no
            difficulties today as everything went smoothly. </p>

        <h3>01.02.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>As our group gathered in the morning on the video chat, we all practiced a lot of times doing the
            presentation to make sure everyone knows what they are doing as their part in the presentation. The teacher
            came into the chat told us all what we must do and gave us a link to the chat that we had to go to do the
            presentation. When we entered the group link, four barber groups competed. We listened to each group, and we
            presented our own presentation when it came our turn to do it. After all the presentations a winner was
            decided by three women judging that barber group number 3 won. Everyone was incredibly happy with their work
            on what they did as everyone tried their best at doing. After the winner was announced we went back into our
            own groups and the teacher asked us howwe got on or what we thought of it. Everyone was happy with the
            outcome and even the teacher said he was happy with all our hard work.</p>

        <h3>02.02.2024. 10am-4pm</h3>
        <p>For the last day of our work experience we all gathered into the main meeting video chat to listen to four
            winner groups presenting their presentations. They were all incredibly good and had different ideas on the
            businesses, after all the presentations then we had a tech support speaker to tell us about tech
            recruitment. After the tech speaker finished his speech, the main leader thanked us for all our hard work
            and said goodbye.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Overall, it was an interesting, enjoyable, and valuable experience. Met new people and enjoyed working with
            them as they were a nice team to have. If needed I would happily, do it all over again. This is splendid
            work experience to have for my future employment as I had an opportunity to experience working in a team.
